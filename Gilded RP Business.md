## 🔹 Resources for Businesses

## 🔹 Starting a Business

- **Application Submission:** Business applications must be sent to our [Application Bot](https://discord.com/channels/737446331920023628/1003417113781870592/1449415362390265979). Please note that you must be a citizen of the area (USA, Guarma, Mexico) before submitting your application. Applications will have deadlines and will be reviewed and voted on by Jr. Admin+ before being accepted or rejected.
- **Post-Application Acceptance:** If your business application is accepted, you will receive an acceptance message from the bot. Once you receive such a message, open a support ticket to begin the setup process.

## 🔹 Maintaining a Business

- Once your acceptance letter has been reviewed and saved:

### 🔹 Loan Payments
- First priority should be paying off your loan. Once paid off, you must wait 30 days after payment before receiving your first custom item.
    - Loans can be paid off in chunks. Please open a ticket once the funds are available.
    - After your first custom item, you must wait 90 days for your next free item.
    - Additionally, if you are eligible to purchase more items past your free item, and choose to do so, you are required to wait **120 days** for the next free item.
    - Businesses that are eligible to create collaborations may begin to create them **30 days** after the loan is paid off.
  
---

## 🔹 Business Collaborations

- Business collaborations are capped at one (1) per non-collaborative business per three (3) months.
    - Example: if you purchase a collaboration soda as a saloon, it would count towards your saloon's one (1) collaboration slot, and your business will be eligible for another business collaboration after three (3) months.
    - The collaborating business must solely sell this item to the business that paid for the collaboration. If caught selling the item without permission, it can result in legal action in character.

---

## 🔹 Custom Item Restrictions

We have only a few restrictions regarding items:
- No protective vests.
- Price gouging is not allowed, and you will be pulled into a ticket if caught doing so. If the act is continued after it has been addressed, you will be subjected to a harsher punishment.
    - Price gouging is when someone sells an item for way more than it’s actually worth, especially compared to the cost of materials. **The maximum allowed price of a product is no more than 300% of its material cost. Violations may lead to a business strike or repossession.**  
   _This rule applies to custom machines and items created by businesses. It aims to keep such products accessible and prevent them from being overpriced. Smaller items, such as food, may continue to be sold at their current prices._
- You are allowed to make a similar item to another business; however, you may not include verbiage that indicates the item is "better" or language that insinuates competition.

---

## 🔹 Selling or Transferring a Business

- **Ownership Limit:** You are required to own your business for at least 90 days before a business is sold or transferred. As stated in the rules, if you sell/transfer your business before your 90-day period is over, you will be blacklisted from owning another business.
    - If you sell your business, you are required to wait 30 days before applying for a new business.
- **Private Sale of Business:** Private business sales include set taxes that must be paid to the government. This tax is 25% of the business's appraised price, as listed in the **Public Record of Business Owners & Business Prices.** This tax is non-negotiable. You are **required** to open a ticket before selling a business to inform the Business Team of your intent to sell, and you must provide documentation upon the sale of the business.
- **Private Transfer of Business:** Transfers must be documented in a ticket with the proper paperwork. Private transfers still require the payment of a 25% tax to the government, as mentioned above.
- **Last Wills & Business:** Businesses cannot be added to a character's will. If a character dies, their business will either be inherited by their most active employee or revert to the application process if the most active employee already owns a business. The business may also revert to the application process if there are no active employees.

## 🔹 Repossession Rules

If a business is perceived to be inactive, players can open a ticket to inquire about it. If a business is found to be inactive (with no player activity or inventory movement) for 30 days, or if it does not provide any roleplay activities without an LOA notice, the business will be repossessed by the government. If the business is repossessed, the previous owner will be blacklisted from owning a business for 90 days.

- If you will be inactive, please submit an LOA via ticket with a timeline. If you need to extend your LOA, please open a follow-up ticket.
