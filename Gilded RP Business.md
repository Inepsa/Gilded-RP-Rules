## 🔹 Resources for Businesses

- **Public Record of Business Owners & Business Prices:** https://bit.ly/new-public-grant-record
- **Business Customs Pricing:** https://bit.ly/grant-bus-pricing

## 🔹 Starting a Business

- **Application Submission:** Business applications must be sent to our Roles & Applications tab (https://discord.com/channels/737446331920023628/1003417113781870592/1384588523306356940). Please note that you must be a citizen of the area (USA, Guarma, Mexico) before submitting your application. Applications will have deadlines and will be reviewed and voted on by Jr. Admin+ before being accepted or rejected.
- **Post-Application Acceptance:** If your business application is accepted, you will receive an acceptance message from the bot. Once you receive such a message, open a support ticket to begin the setup process.

## 🔹 Maintaining a Business

- Once your acceptance letter has been reviewed and saved:

### 🔹 Loan Payments
- First priority should be paying off your loan. Once paid off, you must wait 30 days after payment before receiving your first item.
    - Loans can be paid off in chunks. Please open a ticket once the funds are available.
    - After that, you must wait 90 days for your next free item.
    - Additionally, if you purchase more items past your free item, you are required to wait **120 days** for the next free item.
    - Businesses that are eligible to create collaborations are also eligible to create them after the  **30 days** after the loan is paid off.
---

## 🔹 Business Collaborations

- Business collaborations are capped at one (1) per non-collaborative business per three (3) months.
    - Example: if you purchase a collaboration soda as a saloon, it would count towards your saloon's one collaboration slot, and your business will be eligible for another business collaboration after three (3) months.
    - The collaborating company must solely sell this item to the business that paid for the collaboration. If caught selling the item without permission, it can result in legal actions in character.

---

## 🔹 Custom Item Restrictions

We have only a few restrictions regarding items:
- No bags/containers that can hold items.
- No protective vests.
- Price gouging is not allowed, and you will be pulled over for a ticket if caught doing so. If the act is continued after being pulled over for it, you will be subjected to a harsher punishment.
    - Price gouging is when someone sells an item for way more than it’s actually worth, especially compared to the cost of materials. **The maximum allowed price of a product is no more than 300% of its material cost. Violations may lead to a business strike or repossession.**  
   _This rule applies to custom machines and items created by businesses. It aims to keep such products accessible and prevent them from being overpriced. Smaller items, such as food, may continue to be sold at their current prices._
- You are allowed to make a similar item to another business; however, you may not include verbiage that indicates the item is "better" or language that insinuates competition.

---

## 🔹 Selling or Transferring a Business

- **Ownership Limit:** You are required to own your business for at least 90 days before a business is sold or transferred. As stated in the rules, if you sell/transfer your business before your 90-day period is over, you will be blacklisted from owning another business.
    - If you sell your business, you are required to wait 30 days before applying for a new business.
- **Private Sale of Business:** Businesses have set prices that must be paid out to the predecessor. You may not overpay or underpay for the business, and you are required to submit documentation in a ticket. You are **REQUIRED** to open a ticket before selling a business to inform the Staff about the intent to sell.
- **Private Transfer of Business:** Transfers must be documented in a ticket with the proper paperwork.
- **Last Wills & Business:** Businesses cannot be added to a character's will. If a character dies, their business will either be inherited by their most active employee or revert to the application process if the most active employee already owns a business.

## 🔹 Repossession Rules

If a business is inactive, players are allowed to open a ticket and inquire about said business. If a business is inactive (with no player activity or inventory movement) for 30 days or the business does not provide any roleplay activities without an LOA notice, that business will be repossessed by the government, and the owner will be blacklisted from owning a business for 90 days.

- If you will be inactive, please submit an LOA via ticket with a timeline. If you need to extend the length of your LOA, please open a follow-up ticket.

If you have any questions regarding businesses, please submit a ticket.
